      <p>
          I am a Web Developer with a keen eye for creating visually appealing and 
          user friendly applications. During Bootcamp, me and two team members developed a 
          Cryptocurrency News Application using two API resources and the lesser utilized 
          Bulma CSS Framework. After receiving a Certificate in Full-Stack Web Development 
          from UTSA Bootcamp, Iâ€™ve enjoyed working on the Front-End of applications--
          specifically with CSS and bringing the page to life with JavaScript functionality. 
          In the future, I see myself as a Full-Stack Developer leading a team that creates a 
          variety of web applications. I believe my background as a supervisor in the oilfield 
          has prepared me for working with teams and exceeding client demand and expectations.
